# launchbar-actions
A few quick actions I've thrown together as I've needed them. These actions are not signed at this time.

## FTX price

Check the price of any perpetual future and its underlying asset on [FTX](https://ftx.com). Supports live feedback.


## Add clipboard to Anki

Add a new note to [Anki](http://ankiweb.net/) with the current clipboard contents as front content, and the argument as back content. Requires [Anki Connect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

The preferences (model and deck name) are in resources/prefs.json because I did not feel like using LaunchBar's preferences system. It does not give you any UI to edit them, and it's much easier to read a JSON file than a plist.


## Search on Naver Dictionary

Search the given word on the [Naver Korean-English Dictionary](http://en.dict.naver.com/). As with the regular site search, it doesn't matter if you're searching from Korean or English.


## Upload to Transfer.SH

Upload a file to [Transfer.SH](https://transfer.sh). most useful when using [Instant Send](https://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/InstantSend.html), just send a file straight to the action and get a URL back.
