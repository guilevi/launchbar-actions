# launchbar-actions
A few quick actions I've thrown together as I've needed them. These actions are not signed at these time.

## FTX price

Check the price of any perpetual future and its underlying asset on [FTX](https://ftx.com). Supports live feedback.

## Add clipboard to Anki

Add a new note to [Anki](http://ankiweb.net/) with the current clipboard contents as front content, and the argument as back content. Requires [Anki Connect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

The preferences (model and deck name) are in resources/prefs.json because I did not feel like using LaunchBar's preferences system. It does not give you any UI to edit them, and it's much easier to read a JSON file than a plist.
